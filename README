HOME AUTOMATION USING EEG SIGNALS

The primary objective of this project is to develop an EEG-controlled wheelchair system and home automation system using the Neurosky EEG headset. This system aims to improve the lifestyle of the physically challenged and people with neuro-muscular diseases by controlling the mobility of wheelchairs and switching ON/OFF electrical devices.
This system attempts to satisfy the overall needs of the physically challenged and mobility impaired people with minimal or no need for any physical commands like clapping hands, movement of limbs, and voice commands. Thus, the proposed system only uses the EEG signals that support a large community of people irrespective of their type of disability.
